# Lunar-Solar-Calendar
A lunar solar calendar for the iPhone created by a group of college students. This application allows you to view Lunar Rise/Set, Solar Rise/Set, Lunar Phase Info, and Eclipse times for a period between 1 AD. and 5399 AD. 
We used the Swiss Ephemeris library by Astro Dienst, allowing you to view all of this data, offline, in the palm of your hand.
